      "- **Database Query Operator:** The `@` symbol is a powerful operator for querying the database. Combined with cardinality operators (`@?`, `@`, `@*`, `@+`), it allows for precise retrieval of data based on conditions.\n",
      "- **Mutable Fields:** The `mutable` keyword enables fields within entities or structs to be modified. This is essential for updating data in the blockchain's state.\n",
      "- **Create, Update, and Delete Keywords:** These keywords simplify data manipulation within the database, providing intuitive commands for creating, modifying, and removing entity instances.\n",
      "- **Built-in Functions:** Rell offers built-in functions like `op_context.last_block_time` and `chain_context.blockchain_rid` for accessing blockchain-specific data, such as timestamps and blockchain IDs.\n",
      "- **Require Function:** The `require` function provides a concise way to perform assertions and throw exceptions if conditions are not met, ensuring code reliability.\n",
      "- **Custom Operations and Queries:** Developers can define custom operations (for modifying blockchain state) and queries (for retrieving data) to implement specific dapp logic.\n",

      "\n",
      "These constructs highlight some key differences between Rell and languages like Kotlin, particularly in its focus on relational data modeling, blockchain-specific features, and data immutability.
